# MAGE (Monoclonal Antibody Generator) Agent

## Overview
The **MAGE Agent** interfaces with the **Monoclonal Antibody Generator (MAGE)** model (Vanderbilt, 2025). It is a specialized protein language model designed for the *de novo* design of antibodies against viral targets, even those with high mutational escape potential.

## Features
- **Antigen-Conditional Generation**: Generates CDR (Complementarity-Determining Region) sequences conditioned on a target antigen structure or sequence.
- **Epitope Targeting**: Can be directed to bind specific epitopes (e.g., RBD of Spike protein).
- **Developability Checks**: Auto-filters sequences for solubility, aggregation, and immunogenicity.

## Workflow
1.  **Input**: Viral antigen PDB or FASTA.
2.  **Generation**: Sampling diverse antibody sequences (VHH or IgG).
3.  **Filtering**: Developability assessment.
4.  **Docking Validation**: Verification using AlphaFold-Multimer or specialized antibody docking tools.
