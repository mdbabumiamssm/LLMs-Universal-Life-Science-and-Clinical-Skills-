# Quantum Simulation Agent

## Overview
The **Quantum Simulation Agent** is designed to simulate the electronic structure of complex metalloenzymes and transition states that are computationally intractable for classical DFT (Density Functional Theory). It focuses on high-precision energy estimation using Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) and advanced fault-tolerant algorithms.

## Features
- **Active Space Selection**: Automatically identifies active orbitals for quantum simulation.
- **QPE Simulation**: Estimates ground state energies with chemical accuracy (< 1 kcal/mol).
- **Metalloenzyme Focus**: Specialized for systems with transition metals (e.g., Fe, Mo in Nitrogenase).
- **Azure Quantum Elements Interface**: Ready for integration with Microsoft's hybrid compute stack.

## Use Cases
- Catalyst design for nitrogen fixation.
- Understanding reaction mechanisms in cytochrome P450.
- Photosynthesis complex simulation.
