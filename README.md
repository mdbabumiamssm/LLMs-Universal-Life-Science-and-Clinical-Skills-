## 🚀 Overview

This repository acts as a **Biomedical Operating System (BioOS)**, orchestrating a comprehensive library of **skills, agents, and mathematical foundations** for modern (2026) Artificial Intelligence. 

Unlike standard codebases, this project transforms static scripts into **Agentic Workflows**—where autonomous systems plan, execute, use tools, and correct themselves to solve complex scientific problems. It is designed to support high-impact research, clinical decision support, and automated lab operations.

## 🌟 Major Updates (February 2026)

We have significantly expanded the **Skills** directory to align with the 2026 roadmap, introducing the `SKILL.md` metadata standard and deploying high-performance agents across key domains.

### 🧬 Genomics & Bioinformatics
*   **BioMaster:** `Skills/Genomics/Multi_Agent_Workflows/BioMaster` - A master orchestrator for RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and Hi-C pipelines.
*   **CellAgent:** `Skills/Genomics/Single_Cell/CellAgent` - Autonomous single-cell annotation and quality control.
*   **CompBioAgent:** `Skills/Genomics/Single_Cell/CompBioAgent` - Interactive scRNA-seq explorer and visualization tool.
*   **STAgent:** `Skills/Genomics/Spatial_Transcriptomics/STAgent` - Spatial transcriptomics analysis for Visium/Xenium data.

### 🏥 Clinical & Operations
*   **ChatEHR:** `Skills/Clinical/EHR/ChatEHR` - Clinical assistant for summarizing patient records and answering queries.
*   **TrialGPT:** `Skills/Clinical/Trial_Matching/TrialGPT` - Intelligent patient-to-trial matching and ranking.
*   **RadGPT:** `Skills/Clinical/Radiology/RadGPT` - Radiology report summarizer and patient-friendly explainer.
*   **Autonomous Oncology Agent:** Precision oncology treatment planning using multimodal data (H&E + Genomics).

### 🧪 Drug Discovery & Chemistry
*   **MAGE:** `Skills/Drug_Discovery/Antibody_Design/MAGE` - Generative antibody design using protein language models.
*   **CheMatAgent:** `Skills/Drug_Discovery/CheMatAgent` - Computational chemistry agent for molecule design and property prediction.
*   **Biomni:** `Skills/Research_Tools/Biomni` - General-purpose biomedical research agent with access to 150+ tools.

### 🔍 Knowledge & Research
*   **KRAGEN:** `Skills/Research_Tools/Knowledge_Graphs/KRAGEN` - Knowledge Graph-Enhanced RAG for complex reasoning.
*   **LEADS:** `Skills/Research_Tools/Literature_Mining/LEADS` - Automated systematic review and meta-analysis agent.
*   **BioMCP:** `Skills/MCP_Servers/BioMCP` - Model Context Protocol server for connecting LLMs to PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and more.

## 🧹 Recent Curation (March 2026)

We also started curating the user-focused Babu collection to make the highest-value skills easier to trigger and maintain.

- `Skills/User_Collections/Babu/computational-software-development` now uses a compact workflow-oriented skill definition with supporting references.
- `Skills/User_Collections/Babu/bioinformatics-singlecell`, `ngs-analysis`, and `mpn-research-assistant` were rewritten to reduce prompt bloat and improve reuse.
- Two new skills were added for repository stewardship and grounded literature systems:
  - `Skills/User_Collections/Babu/skill-library-maintainer`
  - `Skills/User_Collections/Babu/biomedical-rag-citation-pipelines`
- The Babu collection README now reflects the curated layout and reference-first organization.

## 📂 Directory Structure

The repository is organized into domain-specific modules:

```text
Skills/
├── Agentic_AI/           # Orchestrators, Swarms, Planning Agents
├── Clinical/             # EHR, Radiology, Oncology, Trials
├── Drug_Discovery/       # Antibody Design, Small Molecules, Chemistry
├── Genomics/             # Single Cell, Spatial, CRISPR, Variant Interpretation
├── MCP_Servers/          # BioMCP and other protocol servers
├── Research_Tools/       # Biomni, Literature Mining, Knowledge Graphs
├── Pharma/               # Regulatory Affairs, Pharmacovigilance
└── Software_Engineering/ # Best Practices (React, Python, Pandas)
```

## 📜 Standardized Skill Format

The repository is migrating toward a lean **SKILL.md** standard so skills are easier to discover and cheaper to load into context. Curated skills should prefer:
*   **Name:** Hyphen-case skill identifier.
*   **Description:** Concise trigger guidance that states what the skill does and when to use it.
*   **Workflow body:** Short operational instructions rather than large code dumps.
*   **References:** Detailed domain notes moved into `references/` when they are not needed on every invocation.
*   **Agents metadata:** Optional `agents/openai.yaml` for curated skills that should surface cleanly in UI-driven environments.

## 🛠️ Usage Examples

**1. Match a Patient to a Clinical Trial (TrialGPT):**
```bash
python3 Skills/Clinical/Trial_Matching/TrialGPT/run_matching.py --patient_profile ./patient.json
```

**2. Design an Antibody (MAGE):**
```bash
python3 Skills/Drug_Discovery/Antibody_Design/MAGE/generate.py --antigen "spike_protein" --count 5
```

**3. Analyze Spatial Transcriptomics (STAgent):**
```bash
python3 Skills/Genomics/Spatial_Transcriptomics/STAgent/main.py --data ./visium_data.h5ad --task "cluster_domains"
```
